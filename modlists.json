    "description": "Tahrovin Grit is a fork of Tahrovin, a NSFW Skyrim VR modlist. It retains some of the eye-candy its predecessor is known for, but opts for more grounded outfits and slightly less intrusive NSFW mods. It also features light survival gameplay and aims towards a slower-paced character growth, reworking many gameplay mechanics to provide a well-balanced challenge throughout your playthrough.",

    "description": "Spirit of Grit is a hardcore-lite modlist, providing increased challenge without going too far. Gold is precious, character progression is slower, specialization is vital and magic is not a given. Many mod-added gameplay mechanics have been worked into character progression and can be unlocked through skills and custom perks. As a SFW fork of Tahrovin Grit, the modlist also overhauls visuals and includes a lot of new quests, all of them fully tested and patched, bringing many hours of new content.",
